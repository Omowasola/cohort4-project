## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my Final Project For cohort4 in HerTechTrail.This is a portfolio project.

## The challenge

The challenge is to create a responsive Portfolio Page that can adjust to any media screen using the template given to us. 

## About My Project

This is a portfolio webpage created using the template given to us with the help of HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,Javascript and PHP on Visualstudio code.The portfolio webpage is rsponsive and can adjust to any media screen size.
The template was given to us by our instructor.

## Building My project

We were asked to fork the project from our instructor's github account to ours and then clone to our local device and create our portfolio webpage to our desired look before pushing it back.
I used the guidelines and assets given to us to create my portfolio project, then i updated my readme file. Finally i initalized my project,added my new files,committed my changes, then pushed the project to my github from gitbash.

Despite the fact that this project was kind of tough and complicated at some point,it was also one of interesting and best project ever.
